# Ruby bindings for FreeLing [![status](http://stillmaintained.com/munshkr/freeling-ruby.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/munshkr/freeling-ruby)

This library is in active development, but it is not functional as of today.
Please contact me if you want to collaborate.

There is also [another project](https://github.com/munshkr/freeling-analyzer-ruby)
that wraps around the `analyzer` program that comes with the FreeLing library.
You can use it for tokenizing or PoS tagging a text.
