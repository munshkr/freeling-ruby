    flexible multiword recognition, contraction splitting, probabilistic
    prediction of unkown word categories, named entity detection, recognition of
    dates, numbers, ratios, currency, and physical magnitudes (speed, weight,
    temperature, density, etc.), PoS tagging, chart-based shallow parsing, named
    entity classification, WordNet based sense annotation and disambiguation,
    rule-based dependency parsing, and nominal correference resolution.
    Currently supported languages are Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian,
